\section{Rationale}

The current state of the art of dealing at runtime of types involves
manipulating and traversing statically defined type descriptors. These type
descriptors contain information about the types theyâ€™re supposed to represent
(members, inheritance hierarchy, etc.) and are encapsulated with the same type
they typically describe. This is useful for determining at runtime for example
how to display certain pieces of information.
