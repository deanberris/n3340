\label{appendix:introspection}

Introspection is a major capability missing from C++. With it, software
components have the ability to simultaneously interact more intimately and
more generically.

For example, the JavaBeans \cite{javabeans} architecture uses a combination of
introspection and naming conventions to enable the automatic lookup,
discovery, instantiation, and initialization of Java classes from a data
definition that’s only available at class time. One common use is for an
application to read in a row of a table in a database and call setY on an
entity class (called a Bean in Java terminology) for every column Y in the
row. The application’s code can use metadata from the database to get all the
columns available, and introspect the bean to find and call the appropriate
initialization method.

Java, Smalltalk, and Objective-C provide introspection via runtime data
structures. Such data structures are generated for each class, method, and
member. For large systems, the storage overhead can become significant. Also,
the introspection requires runtime access to work; adding overhead to the
system’s runtime.

OpenC++\cite{chiba} provides a mechanism for compiler plug--ins to extend the
language itself.
