\section{Overview}

This paper proposes the definition of a standardized rich pointer and type
descriptor construct in C++ to allow for standardized and efficient runtime and
compiletime introspection of types and objects. Here we propose the semantics
for a rich pointer and examples of programming problems addressed by this
construct. We also provide an appendix on current reflection and introspection facilities.
