\section{Overview}

This paper proposes the definition of a standardized rich pointer and type
descriptor construct in C++ to allow for standardized and efficient runtime
introspection of types and objects. Here we propose the syntax and semantics for
a rich pointer and examples of programming problems addressed by this construct.
