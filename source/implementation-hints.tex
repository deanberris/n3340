\section{Implementation Hints}

This section provides information about how we could implement rich pointers
in the context of C++11. We approach it by first writing a library solution
that approximates the functionality using available language features in
C++11. We then show what the limitations of the language and runtime are along
the way and work towards removing the limitations.

\subsection{Library Components}

Here we present a first crack at providing rich pointer support using a
template we'll call \verb+rich_ptr+. The goal of \verb+rich_ptr+ is to provide
functionality for the definition and registration of types and objects of
these types in the same object. Instances of \verb+rich_ptr+ will follow
pointer semantics similar to what \verb+shared_ptr+ provides without the
reference counting capability.

In \autoref{appendix:rich_ptr-interface} we show what the interface for a
\verb+rich_ptr+ would look like. The minimal interface is by design meant to
mimic how pointers work. There are no special member functions except for
overloads to the dereference operator and the member access operator.

We then supply a means to programmatically defining type descriptors following
the already presented type descriptors by hand.
\autoref{appendix:rich_ptr-annotations} shows how these macros would look like
and what their intended semantics are.

\subsubsection{Limitations}

There are a few problems in the library-only approach:

\begin{itemize}

 \item The syntax of the macros is very explicit and too verbose and deviates
too much from the normal C++ syntax for class definitions.

 \item Because you have to consciously annotate the type you’re registering,
this makes it hard to manage especially if the type’s definition is not
something you can change (i.e. when using a third-party provided library).

 \item This will not properly handle dynamically loaded libraries at runtime
and will be at the mercy of the implementation and platform.

\end{itemize}

With a library-only implementation we cannot do the following reliably:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Safe runtime type invalidation.} This will require two things:

  \begin{itemize}

   \item A standardized registry of types available and managed at runtime.

   \item Well defined module initialization/cleanup semantics and interfaces.

  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Seamless invalidation at runtime.} Because of the linkage and
  concurrency issues introduced by standard-allowed optimizations, it is not
  guaranteed that library-defined invalidation routines can be protected. The
  worst case scenario is that code paths and branches that can be optimized
  appropriately using normal pointers as opposed to rich pointers are in
  jeopardy of behaving much poorly.

  \item \textbf{Safe runtime type creation.} For JIT compilers at the moment,
  only code and data that’s accessible through opaque pointers (\verb+void *+)
  and rigidly-defined function pointers that have primitive return types can
  be integrated into the hosting runtime context. New types cannot be safely
  registered and invalidated without explicit runtime support of type
  registration.

  \item \textbf{Automatic descriptor generation.} With the library approach
  types need to be explicitly registered and annotated. The compiler on the
  other hand has all the information it needs and can generate the type
  information at compilation time and can do so only for types that are used
  in rich pointers and types pointed to by rich pointers.

\end{itemize}

A previous version of this paper was proposing to add a new pointer type. The downside to that approach would be that the work required to change the standard defining a new pointer type is not enough to justify the gains.

This version of the paper introduces a hybrid approach which shows what rich pointers would look like with a library interface (\verb+rich_ptr+) while introducing some compiler assistance functionality (\verb+type_descriptor+ and \verb+metadata+).
