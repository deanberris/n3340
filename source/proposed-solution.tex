\section{Proposed Solution}

The problems raised above point to general dynamic programming utilities called
runtime introspection and reflection. Enabling introspection and reflection at
runtime has traditionally been costly and almost always requires the concept of
a virtual machine for it to be doable. In this section we describe a mechanism
for enabling introspection and potentially reflection without the need for a
heavyweight virtual machine or runtime to make it possible.

There are two parts to this proposed solution: a smart pointer library and some
compiler-assistance to generate static information. The smart pointer library
provides the runtime introspection facilities, while compiler-assistance and
static introspection capabilities along with additional traits cover the
compile-time introspection facilities.
