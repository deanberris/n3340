\section{Proposed Solution}

The problems raised above point to general dynamic programming utilities called
runtime introspection and reflection. Enabling introspection and reflection at
runtime has traditionally been costly and almost always requires the concept of
a virtual machine for it to be doable. In this paper we describe a mechanism for
enabling introspection and potentially reflection without the need for a
heavyweight virtual machine or runtime to make it possible. The benefits include
but are not limited to: better runtime debugging and instrumentation for
profiling as well as for first-class garbage collection support.
