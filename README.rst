Rich Pointers
=============

This repository is the translated source for the Rich Pointers proposal
published first as part of the Pre-Kona ISO C++ Committee meeting. The document
was originally written in Google Docs that was collaboratively edited with
comments from other Google engineers.

The sources here are in LaTeX which encapsulates different parts of the
proposal.

Building the PDF
----------------

You will need a TeX processor (more specifically, a LaTeX distribution) to be
able to generate the PDFs. On the mac, the following commands allow for building
the PDF::

    cd source/
    texi2pdf n3340.tex

The resulting PDF should be in the same directory.
